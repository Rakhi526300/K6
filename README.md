K6 is an open-source load testing tool designed for developers to test the performance and reliability of web applications and APIs. It allows users to simulate virtual users, generate high loads, and analyze system behavior under stress. Written in JavaScript, K6 provides a scriptable and developer-friendly environment, making it easy to define test scenarios and automate performance testing. Unlike traditional load testing tools, K6 is lightweight, efficient, and integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling continuous performance monitoring. With its detailed reports and metrics, K6 helps developers identify bottlenecks, optimize system performance, and ensure scalability before deployment.
